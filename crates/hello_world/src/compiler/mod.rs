//! # The Pulsar Blueprint Compiler
//! 
//! This module contains the implementation of the Pulsar Blueprint Compiler.
//! The compiler is responsible for transforming high-level blueprint definitions
//! into executable rust code that can be run through either rust-script or compiled
//! into a binary via internal `cargo build`.
//! 
//! This process involves several steps, including parsing the blueprint syntax,
//! type checking, and generating the final rust code. The compiler is designed to
//! be extensible, allowing for the addition of new features and optimizations in the future.
//! 
//! ## Defining Nodes
//! 
//! Nodes are defined using the Tron template language, which provides a simple and expressive way
//! to describe the structure and behavior of rust code and insert dynamic values. Each node is
//! it's very own Tron template file in the ./nodes directory.
//! 
//! ## User-defined Nodes
//! 
//! Users can also define their own custom nodes by creating new .tron files in the ./nodes directory
//! of their project. These files should follow the same structure as the built-in nodes, and can include
//! any necessary metadata such as input and output types, descriptions, and categories.
//! The compiler will automatically detect and include these user-defined nodes when generating
//! the library of available nodes for blueprints via the project build.rs script.
//! 
//! ### Reading Node Definitions
//! 
//! The compiler will read these .tron files and use them to generate the library of nodes that can
//! be used in blueprints via the UI. From there, users can drag and drop nodes into their blueprints
//! and connect them together to create complex workflows. Nodes that connect cause the Tron template
//! engine to render the templates together, inserting dynamic values and interconnecting the code as
//! needed.
//! 
//! ## Node execution
//! 
//! Once the blueprint has been fully defined and the nodes have been connected, the compiler will
//! generate the final rust code by rendering the Tron templates together. This code can then be
//! executed using rust-script for quick iteration and testing in the editor, or compiled into a binary for
//! production use.
//! 
//! The compiler also includes error handling and reporting features, allowing users to easily identify
//! and fix issues in their blueprints. Overall, the Pulsar Blueprint Compiler is designed to be a powerful
//! and flexible tool for creating and executing complex workflows using a visual programming approach.
